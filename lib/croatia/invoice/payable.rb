# Provides payment barcode generation functionality for Croatian invoices
#
# This concern adds the ability to generate HUB-3 compatible payment barcodes
# for Croatian bank transfers. The generated barcodes can be scanned by banking
# applications to pre-fill payment forms with invoice details.
#
# The payment barcode includes:
# - Currency and total amount
# - Buyer and seller information (names, addresses, postal codes, cities)
# - Seller's IBAN or account number
# - Optional payment reference details (model, reference number, purpose code)
# - Payment description (defaults to "Ra훾un {invoice_number}")
#
# @example Basic usage
#   invoice = Croatia::Invoice.new
#   invoice.buyer = Croatia::Invoice::Party.new(name: "John Doe", address: "Address 1")
#   invoice.seller = Croatia::Invoice::Party.new(name: "Company", iban: "HR1234567890123456789")
#
#   barcode = invoice.payment_barcode
#   png_data = barcode.to_png
#
# @example With custom parameters
#   barcode = invoice.payment_barcode(
#     description: "Payment for services",
#     model: "HR01",
#     reference_number: "123-456-789",
#     payment_purpose_code: "SALA"
#   )
